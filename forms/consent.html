Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand anyaccompanying information.</i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This experiment examines your ability to remember words. Your performance will be compared to computational models of semantic memory. This is done so in an effort to assess if they are descriptive models of human behavior.<br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: 
In this experiment, you will be presented with a list of words, one at a time.  Afterward, you will be tested on a set of words. All answers will be collected by the computer.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are typically no risks involved, greater than that which you might experience in the normal conduct of your everyday. If you become tired, you should take a break. You are free to discontinue participation at any time and with no consequences. You will benefit from participating by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Digital data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely on a password protected laboratory computer.  Hard copies of your data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely in a file cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. This consent form will be kept in a cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. It will be destroyed on April 1, 2022.<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: This experiment takes about 10 minutes to complete and you will receive 1 experimental credit (SONA).<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the experiment, you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time and with no consequence.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: Following the experiment, you will be shown a screen that explains the experiment in writing.  If you are interested in learning the outcome of this specific experiment, please visit the website provided. We will send you a description as soon as possible, but no later than August 30, 2021.<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The results of the study will be presented at academic conferences and published in academic journals.<br/><br/>

<b>Consent: <i>SONA participants:</i></b> please print a copy of this consent form for your records. If you wish to participate in the experiment please click the button to begin the study. <br/><br/>

<i>Your willingness to proceed and agree indicates that you have understood to your satisfaction the information regarding participation in the research project and agree to participate as a subject. In no way does this waive your legal rights nor release the researchers, sponsors, or involved institutions from their legal and professional responsibilities.
