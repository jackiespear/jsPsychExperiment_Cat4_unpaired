# jsPsych Word Categorization Experiment 4b
A jsPsych implicit learning experiment.

## Purpose

This experiment was a collaboration between the Jamieson Lab at the University of Manitoba and Dr. Evan Curtis at Booth University. Data collected was compared to performance of an instance-based model of human memory, MINERVA 2.

In an implicit learning experiment, participants study a list of words that are chosen on the basis of a rule. They are then are asked to classify new test words that conform to that rule. Even though people are never told what the rule is, they are often able to sort rule-following from rule-violating words. 
The test procedure in Experiment 4a was a 2AFC task to choose the rule conforming word. The test procedure used here in Experiment 4b was a yes/no recognition task. Materials were an equal amount of of concrete and abstract low frequency words, with lures being high frequency words.
